I feel that this is the best way to explain what is going on here for now.

**First prompt to chatGPT (GPT-4):**

lets write a small tool that can help me keep track of the time I spend on various tasks at work. I would want to write a tool that saves the type of window I have active and record when and for how long I use each.

Then I would aggregate this over each day. So I can see how much time is spent on vscode, outlook and how much is idling.

How would we go about doing that? I prefer python if possible.
